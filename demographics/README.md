# PLAY project site demographics

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the demographics of the population in and around the PLAY project's targeted data collection sites across the U.S. and Canada.

- `analysis` contains both some preliminary R scripts Rick Gilmore was working on and data files.
    - `analysis/csv` : contains comma-separated value format data files.
        - `analysis/csv/PLAY-data-collection-geolocations.csv` is the most important one of these. Additional data is being gathered from PIs about the zip codes where they typically recruit participants. The other files were used by Rick Gilmore's test scripts.
